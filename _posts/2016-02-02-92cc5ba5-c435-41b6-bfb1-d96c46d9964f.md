Whether you're a single adult or a family of 10, there's a place for you here!

CAUpstate is a community of believers... a family of faith.  
We love big. We worship passionately. We desperately seek to know and share Jesus Christ.

We have many programs and events designed to encourage and grow the faith family at CAU, and we would love for you to be a part! Please plan to join us at any of our services.

Our Sunday Morning Worship Service begins at 10:30\. Our kids are invited to worship with us before being dismissed to attend our Children's Ministry.
