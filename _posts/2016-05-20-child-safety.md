At CAU, nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of your children. That is why we have partnered with KidCheck as our children's check-in solution. What is KidCheck? KidCheck is a secure children's check-in system that enhances our security system and simplifies the check-in process. KidCheck helps ensure no one can pick up your child without your consent.

If you are new to us or are planning on visiting us for the first time we encourage you to set-up your free account using the instructions below. Don't worry though if you do not have time or have problems during the set-up process one of our children's workers, greeters or ushers can help you set-up your account when you arrive. Your KidCheck account can be used at any facility that uses KidCheck as their check-in provider.
