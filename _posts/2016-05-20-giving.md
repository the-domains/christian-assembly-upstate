**Why Give?**

We believe that everything we have is a gift from God and that He wants to use his people to influence the world._1 Chronicles 29:14 "But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand."_When we give the work of the Kingdom is accomplished, the Gospel is preached, missionaries are sent, the hungry is fed, the broken, hurt and sick are healed, and we in turn are blessed so that we can give again ([2 Corinthians 9:6-15][1]).

We believe that you cannot out give God. _Malachi 3:10 "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. "Test me in this", says the Lord Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it."_

**What is a Tithe?**

"tithe", literally means a tenth or 10%. It is defined as the first 10% of your income that is given back to God through your local church. The Bible teaches us that the purpose of tithing is to teach us to always put God first in your lives._Proverbs 3:9-10 "Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; then you barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine."_
